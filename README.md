    <h1>Visualize Data with QuickSight ðŸ“Š</h1>
    <p>
        I'm thrilled to share my latest project where I've utilized Amazon QuickSight to visualize complex datasets effortlessly. ðŸš€
    </p>
    <p>
        In my recent project, I leveraged Amazon QuickSight to create insightful visualizations from diverse data sources, including CSV files and databases like Kaggle. The <code>manifest.json</code> file played a crucial role in guiding QuickSight on how to interpret and present the data accurately, ensuring clear and impactful insights.
